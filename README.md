This project is a front-end webpage designed as a landing page for a financial services platform, visually inspired by Razorpay.

It showcases features like a payment suite, various financial products (e.g., payment links, subscriptions, business banking tools like current accounts and payouts) using a responsive layout with navigation, a hero section, and card-based displays.

Key technologies used are HTML5, CSS3 (with custom animations), Tailwind CSS for styling, and Feather Icons for SVG iconography.
